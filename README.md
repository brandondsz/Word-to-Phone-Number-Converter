# Word-to-Phone-Number-Converter
Word to Phone Number Converter is used to convert a word to a phone number based on the letter mapping of the international standard keypad of any mobile phone or landline phone. For example, the number for Apple is 27753.

This is an android app built with Xamarin on Visual Studio.(Basically my first go at trying Xamarin)
